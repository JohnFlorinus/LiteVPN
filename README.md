# LiteVPN
LiteVPN is a basic VPN application written from scratch in C# by myself. It utilizes Windows's built-in RasDial function to connect and disconnect from VPN servers, other than this it uses no libraries or third-party dependencies.
LiteVPN has an easy-to-use GUI but other than this it offers few benefits in comparison to simply using RasDial directly. The plan is to implement features such as a kill switch and other special functions to make it useful.
